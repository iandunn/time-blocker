## What's Time Blocking?

[Time blocking](http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/) is a method of planning a schedule for your day, so that you can be *intentional* about focusing on the things that you value the most, rather than just doing whatever feels urgent.
and also intentional about *how much* time you spend on each task, relative to its value 

Because [how you spend your day is how you spend your life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/530337-how-we-spend-our-days-is-of-course-how-we).

it complements systems like [Getting Things Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnnaJkKdwjU), but meets a different need, and can be used independently from them 


## Features

describe how this is different from other apps (long version)

web application so you can use on desktop. mobile interfaces inherintly awful for this kind of thing
keyboard accessible for speed

templates so can quickly setup days based on routine, but each day is independent so can adapt to unique parts of day

plan days based on actual calendar dates rather than abstract days of week - need to explain this better
	have archival record of what you did in past days
	future days are independent from templates, so can edit monday on a sunday without modifying template

automatically show past blocks as complete and highlight current block 


also fun way to play around w/ modern stuff like web componentes, local storage, progressive web app, offline support, manifest

## Instructions for using

download zip? install locally and open browser, or upload to website and use there?
setup http basic auth to avoid other people changing?
	er, no, it's fine b/c localstorage. think through just to be sure though
	even if that's true, maybe warn people to make sure they're aware of it
